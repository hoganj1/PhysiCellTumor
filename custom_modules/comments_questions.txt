Diffusion rate has to be divided by cell area- is that accounted for in the equation?
Or do I have to enter in the modified diffusion rate? (assume it's not accounted for)

// turn off gradient calculations LINE 117
default_microenvironment_options.bool calculate_gradients = false;
**Is calculate_gradients the same as calculate diffusion substrates?
I don't think so- off by default

CHECK PARAM-
uses 10^5 micrometers^2/min for O2 diffusion
decay coefficient .11 micrometers (per 1 mm diffusion length
scale in the absence of cells)

//LINE 127
what does double mechanics_voxel_size = 30; mean??

p 12-13 User_Guide (USE CODE FOR HYPOXIA/NECROSIS CHECKS)
p 13 (dirichlet nodes- places where value of o2 is always the same)- use to create blood vessels if needed

GOAL-simplify cell cycle a LOT
7.4.1 (20-24)- add specific characteristics to cells
7.4.2 - Cell_Param (24-26)
    MODIFY THESE TO MATCH JAVA MODEL
    -simplify(get rid of hypoxic_response and hypoxic_saturation?)
    -change from necrosis rates to hard cutoffs
    -Necrosis type (stochastic or deterministic)
        PhysiCell_constants::deterministic_necrosis or
        PhysiCell_constants::stochastic_necrosis
7.4.3 Cell_functions (26-27)
    in PhysiCell, almost all functions that act on cells take the form
        void function( Cell* pCell, Phenotype& phenotype, double dt ).
        phenotype = pCell->phenotype unless pCell = NULL 
    DONT NEED ANY OF THESE EXCEPT constructor (Cell_Functions())
    class Cell_Functions {
        Cell_Functions(); 
        };
7.4.4 Cell_State (27-29)
    cell descriptors, NOT phenotypes
    what I need- neighbors, orientation
    neighbors- determined by adhesion interaction potential?
    replace pressure w/ quiescence (if too many neighbors)
7.4.4 Cell_Definition (29-30)
    use to create stem and non-stem cells (and initialize them differently)
    updates Cell_Functions, Cell_Parameters, phenotype
    int type, std::string name
8 Phenotype (30-31)
    allows you to specify current state and properties of a cell
    Cycle - different cycles the cell can pass through (death model, other models)
    Secretion and Motility (uptake rates & movement)
9 Phenotype details Cell Cycle (30-)
    double elapsed_time_in_phase
    int current_phase_index
    reduce # of phases to 2- increase elapsed time if enough o2
9.2 Death Models (39-41)
    ASK_NATE 39- way to get rid of these functions
    int add_death_model (double rate, Cycle Model* pModel, Death Parameters& death parameters)
    //add for necrosis and apoptosis (simple models)
9.3 Volume (42-44)
    set volume to unchanging amount (20 micrometers^2)
9.4 Geometry (44-46)
    set radius to 10 micrometers, delete rest
9.5 Mechanics (46-47, adhesion/repulsion-set to 0) 
9.6 Motility (47-48)
    boonl is_motile, double migration_speed
    is_motile false by default 
9.7 Secretion (49-50)
    only need std::vector<double> uptake_rates
10 Cell Containers (50-52)
11 PhysiCell Outputs
